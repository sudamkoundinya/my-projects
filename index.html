      <h2 class="card-title">Dandiya Night</h2>
      <p class="card-text">"On this glorious Dussehra night, as any self-respecting family would, we made sure to complete our Dussehra duties by dancing our way through Dandiya like there was no tomorrow. Because, let's be honest, Dussehra without Dandiya is like biryani without raita—just not right! 🕺💃

        We stepped onto the dance floor with all the enthusiasm of people who haven't seen the sun since last year's festival. And by 'dancing,' I mean flailing around with sticks and pretending to know the steps. 😂
        
        Here’s a snapshot from the night—caught mid-magic, or maybe mid-disaster. Either way, we’re still calling it a win. 😎🔥 #DandiyaDisaster #DussehraVibes #WhoNeedsCoordinationAnyway"</p>

      <h2 class="card-title">Ak's Birthday</h2>
      <p>"Ak's birthday — the day we, the loyal friends, finally did what no one had dared to do before: demanded a party with no excuses or ‘I’m too busy’ nonsense. 🥳 After much convincing (and maybe a little bit of guilt-tripping), the birthday boy finally caved and agreed. The bar was set — a party is happening, no backing out! 🎉

        So, we all ended up at the Country Club for the festivities. A couple of drinks? Check. Snacks? Oh yeah, we ate so much we could've formed our own buffet line. 😂 Jokes? You bet, some of them so bad we might’ve actually killed a few brain cells in the process. 🤦‍♂️
        
        But honestly, it was a day to remember, especially for the birthday boy, Ak — who had no idea what he was getting into, but we made sure he enjoyed every minute of it. Here's to another year of forcing Ak to throw parties. 🍻 #AkTheBirthdayKing #NoExcusesNextYear #MemoriesMade"</p>
